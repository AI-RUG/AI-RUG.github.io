    <h3>Introduction to Programming</h3>
    <p>This assignment is used during the Student for a Day of Artificial Intelligence, to provide a small introduction to programming. The excercises and explanations are designed to be doable yet slightly challening for both complete beginners and people who have a little bit of experience with programming.</p>
